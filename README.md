# raspi #

Raspberry (and other microcontrollers) code in Python.

PirateAudio: Code for PirateAudio board in CircuitPython to display and use buttons.
IMPORTANT: Once you touch pin 19, as piromoni exmaples do, your audio is dead until a reboot. Haven't figured out what magic pull up would "fix" pin 19 once touched, AVOID.
